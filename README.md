### IMPORTANT NOTICE: This project is work in progress. But even when completed you should make your own research of what a production ready cluster means in your environment. Most of the time running the setup using something like kubeadm, k3s or rke2 is a much better choice. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.

# Bootstrap Kubernetes from scratch on a bare metal cluster

Goals:

- [ ] Get as close to a production ready cluster as possible.
- [ ] Make the documentation easy to follow.
- [ ] Inspire more people to learn the lower level concepts of K8s

### Credits where credits are due

I personally learnt these concepts from these sources so some of the documentation is closely represented from their works. Please provide the love they deserve.
